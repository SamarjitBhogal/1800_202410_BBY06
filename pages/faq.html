            Question #2 MY MEDICATION TASTES BAD - WHAT CAN I DO?

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p><strong>Here are some tips for masking a bad taste:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Place the medication in a small amount of food. If the medication is a tablet that cannot be 
                crushed (e.g., extended-release tablets), make sure you swallow the food without chewing. 
                Do not do this if your doctor or pharmacist has told you that the medication must not be taken with food. 
                If you are unsure whether your medication can be taken with food, check with your doctor or pharmacist, 
                or check the label on the bottle or information sheet from the pharmacy.</li> <br>
              <li>For liquid medications, combine it with a small amount of a better-tasting liquids, 
                such as juice or milk. Do not do this if your doctor or pharmacist has told you 
                that the medication must not be taken with juice or milk.</li><br>
              <li>Get a large glass of water ready. Hold your nose, place the medication on the back of your tongue, 
                and then swallow the medication with some water. Use the rest of the water to rinse out your mouth, 
                and then unplug your nose. This works for all kinds of medications, 
                including those that must not be taken with food.</li><br>
              <li>Try sucking on an ice cube to numb your mouth before taking the medication.</li>
            </ul>

            Question #3 MY MEDICATION CONTAINER IS HARD TO OPEN - WHAT SHOULD I DO?

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Try these tips for making your medication containers easier to open:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Non-childproof lids: </strong>Most medications are dispensed in childproof containers. 
                Childproof lids can be very difficult to open. If you are having trouble, 
                ask your pharmacist for non-childproof lids. Remember to always keep medications well away from children.</li>
              <li><strong>Dosettes:</strong> Some pharmacies will package your medication in a dosette for you - find out if 
                your pharmacy offers this service. Alternatively, you can purchase dosette containers and package 
                them for yourself.</li>
              <li><strong>Blister packs:</strong>Some pharmacies will package your medication 
                in blister packs - find out if your pharmacy offers this service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Dosettes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>A “dosette” is a container where you can store and organize your medications 
                into compartments for different times of the day (e.g., morning, noon, afternoon, or bedtime), 
                usually for up to a week at a time. This way, you can see whether you have taken your last dose of medication. 
                You can fill it yourself or have it filled by a pharmacist (which is a good idea if you have a complicated schedule).</li>
              <li>Dosettes may also come with alarms that beep when it is time for your next dose.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Blister pack:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>A “blister pack” is a special method of packing medications, 
                where each dose of medication is placed in a small plastic bubble and backed by a sheet of foil. 
                Medications are organized by day, usually for up to a week at a time. When it is time to take the medication, 
                you simply push the pill through the blister packing. This way, you can see which doses you have taken. <br>
                Other hints: Some conditions, such as arthritis, can make it difficult to open containers. 
                Some people find placing elastic bands around the bottle top makes opening a container easier 
                for people with arthritis and other conditions. Talk to others to see what they do to help 
                open medication bottles. If you have had surgery or have a cast, ask the person picking up 
                your prescription to ask the pharmacist to give you an easy-open bottle.</li>

      <p><strong>Try these tips for easier swallowing:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check to see if you can break, split, or crush your medication into smaller pieces 
          that are easier to swallow. Not all medications can be crushed or broken, 
          so check with your pharmacist before you try this.</li>
        <li>For capsules, pull the capsule apart by holding on to both ends and twisting 
          it to empty the medication into a small amount of food. For slow-release capsules, 
          this may still be done as long as the contents are swallowed without chewing. 
          Check with your pharmacist, or look at the prescription label or 
          information sheet from your pharmacy to make sure you can take your medication with food.</li>
        <li>Check to see if the medication comes in a smaller tablet, as a liquid, 
          or if your pharmacist can make the medication in liquid form for you.</li>
        <li>Place medication in a small amount of food. Some medications can't be taken with food, 
          so check before trying this</li>
        <li>Place medication at the back of the tongue, tilt your head back 
          slightly then take a drink of water to wash it down.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>*If you have medical problems that make it hard for you to swallow 
        (such as partial muscle paralysis after a stroke), talk to your doctor before trying these tips. 
        Your doctor may offer special instructions depending on your condition.</i></p>
