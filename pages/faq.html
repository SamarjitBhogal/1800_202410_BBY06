            Question #2 MY MEDICATION TASTES BAD - WHAT CAN I DO?

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p><strong>Here are some tips for masking a bad taste:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Place the medication in a small amount of food. If the medication is a tablet that cannot be 
                crushed (e.g., extended-release tablets), make sure you swallow the food without chewing. 
                Do not do this if your doctor or pharmacist has told you that the medication must not be taken with food. 
                If you are unsure whether your medication can be taken with food, check with your doctor or pharmacist, 
                or check the label on the bottle or information sheet from the pharmacy.</li> <br>
              <li>For liquid medications, combine it with a small amount of a better-tasting liquids, 
                such as juice or milk. Do not do this if your doctor or pharmacist has told you 
                that the medication must not be taken with juice or milk.</li><br>
              <li>Get a large glass of water ready. Hold your nose, place the medication on the back of your tongue, 
                and then swallow the medication with some water. Use the rest of the water to rinse out your mouth, 
                and then unplug your nose. This works for all kinds of medications, 
                including those that must not be taken with food.</li><br>
              <li>Try sucking on an ice cube to numb your mouth before taking the medication.</li>
            </ul>

            Question #3 MY MEDICATION CONTAINER IS HARD TO OPEN - WHAT SHOULD I DO?

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Try these tips for making your medication containers easier to open:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Non-childproof lids: </strong>Most medications are dispensed in childproof containers. 
                Childproof lids can be very difficult to open. If you are having trouble, 
                ask your pharmacist for non-childproof lids. Remember to always keep medications well away from children.</li>
              <li><strong>Dosettes:</strong> Some pharmacies will package your medication in a dosette for you - find out if 
                your pharmacy offers this service. Alternatively, you can purchase dosette containers and package 
                them for yourself.</li>
              <li><strong>Blister packs:</strong>Some pharmacies will package your medication 
                in blister packs - find out if your pharmacy offers this service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Dosettes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>A “dosette” is a container where you can store and organize your medications 
                into compartments for different times of the day (e.g., morning, noon, afternoon, or bedtime), 
                usually for up to a week at a time. This way, you can see whether you have taken your last dose of medication. 
                You can fill it yourself or have it filled by a pharmacist (which is a good idea if you have a complicated schedule).</li>
              <li>Dosettes may also come with alarms that beep when it is time for your next dose.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Blister pack:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>A “blister pack” is a special method of packing medications, 
                where each dose of medication is placed in a small plastic bubble and backed by a sheet of foil. 
                Medications are organized by day, usually for up to a week at a time. When it is time to take the medication, 
                you simply push the pill through the blister packing. This way, you can see which doses you have taken. <br>
                Other hints: Some conditions, such as arthritis, can make it difficult to open containers. 
                Some people find placing elastic bands around the bottle top makes opening a container easier 
                for people with arthritis and other conditions. Talk to others to see what they do to help 
                open medication bottles. If you have had surgery or have a cast, ask the person picking up 
                your prescription to ask the pharmacist to give you an easy-open bottle.</li>

      <p><strong>Try these tips for easier swallowing:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check to see if you can break, split, or crush your medication into smaller pieces 
          that are easier to swallow. Not all medications can be crushed or broken, 
          so check with your pharmacist before you try this.</li>
        <li>For capsules, pull the capsule apart by holding on to both ends and twisting 
          it to empty the medication into a small amount of food. For slow-release capsules, 
          this may still be done as long as the contents are swallowed without chewing. 
          Check with your pharmacist, or look at the prescription label or 
          information sheet from your pharmacy to make sure you can take your medication with food.</li>
        <li>Check to see if the medication comes in a smaller tablet, as a liquid, 
          or if your pharmacist can make the medication in liquid form for you.</li>
        <li>Place medication in a small amount of food. Some medications can't be taken with food, 
          so check before trying this</li>
        <li>Place medication at the back of the tongue, tilt your head back 
          slightly then take a drink of water to wash it down.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>*If you have medical problems that make it hard for you to swallow 
        (such as partial muscle paralysis after a stroke), talk to your doctor before trying these tips. 
        Your doctor may offer special instructions depending on your condition.</i></p>

      <p>Taking medication exactly as your doctor recommends is not always as simple as it may seem. 
        In fact, it can be quite complex. There are many factors that will make you either more or 
        less likely to take your medication. Some of these factors include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>how easy it is to take the medication</li>
        <li>how many times a day you have to take the medication</li>
        <li>your perception of the benefit of the medication</li>
        <li>your perception of the risks of not taking the medication</li>
        <li>the risks of taking the medication, including side effects</li>
        <li>the total number of pills you take in a day</li>
        <li>how well you perceive the medication to be working</li>
        <li>the cost of the medication</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These are just a few of them. Not all may apply to you, but they will 
        all enter into your decision to take a medication or not. Even if you 
        decide you want to take a medication, it is not always easy to remember 
        to take it. After all, we are humans, not elephants: sometimes we do forget. 
        It can be a challenge to make taking medications a part of your daily routine, 
        but it can become as natural as brushing your teeth or having a meal.</p>
      <p>However, taking medications as prescribed is important. Using medications the right way will help you to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>get the full benefits of your medication.</strong>If you only take 
          half of the medication that was recommended, you will not get the full benefits 
          of the dose that your doctor recommended.</li>
        <li><strong>avoid unwanted side effects.</strong>If you take more medication than 
          recommended because you want more of the benefits of the medication, you are at 
          an increased risk of getting side effects. And you may not get additional benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>avoid medication conflicts.</strong>Some medications should not be taken together. 
          If they are, the effect of one or both of the medications can be increased or decreased, 
          leading to potential problems.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><Strong>Here are some tips:</Strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most medications should be stored in a dry place away from heat and humidity.</li>
        <li>Keep your medication out of the reach of children.</li>
        <li>Some medications also have special instructions for storage. 
          Check for special instructions on your prescription label.</li>
        <li>If your medication needs to be protected from light, keep the medication 
          in its original container and store it in a container that filters out light.</li>

        <li>If your medication needs to be refrigerated, and you do not have a fridge available
           (for example, if you are working outside or on the road all day), try using a cooler 
           with an ice pack. An ordinary cooler found at hardware or sporting goods stores will do.</li>

        <li>Keep track of the expiry dates of the medications. 
          The ideal way to do this is to keep the medications in their original prescription vial. 
          You can also write this information on a sticker and stick it on the container 
          that you are using for the medication.</li>
        <li>Don't store multiple medications in the same vial, as this makes it hard to keep track 
          of which medications are which, which doses have been taken, and what the expiry dates are.</li>
        <li>If you are unsure of how to store your medication, ask your pharmacist.</li>

      <p>Side effects are a serious concern for some people, and they often make you unsure if you wish to keep taking the medication. 
        Here are a few tips to help you cope:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find out more about your medication's side effectsby talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</li>
        <li>If you think you are experiencing side effects, always let your doctor or pharmacist know! Talk to your doctor or 
          pharmacist about the side effects that you are concerned about. They may be able to suggest ways 
          of avoiding or coping with these side effects.</li>
        <li>Some side effects only occur when you start taking a medication or when a dose is increased, 
          but then go away after you have taken the medication for a while. 
          Other side effects can be a sign of a serious reaction to the medication, 
          that's why you need to talk to a health care professional.</li>
        <li>If side effects are too much of a problem, your doctor may 
          prescribe a different medication to treat your condition.</li>
